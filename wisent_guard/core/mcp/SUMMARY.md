# Wisent-Guard MCP Server - Summary

## What is this?

The Wisent-Guard MCP (Model Control Protocol) server enables **models to perform self-reflection and behavior editing on their own outputs**. This is a powerful capability that allows AI models to:

1. **Detect when they are hallucinating** or producing factually incorrect information
2. **Identify problematic behaviors** like bias, toxicity, or nonsense
3. **Automatically improve their responses** using steering methods
4. **Monitor their own performance** and learn from mistakes

## Key Capabilities

### 🔍 Self-Reflection Analysis
- **Hallucination Detection**: Identifies factual errors, impossible dates, anachronisms
- **Quality Assessment**: Scores responses on accuracy, coherence, relevance, helpfulness  
- **Behavior Analysis**: Detects bias, toxicity, repetition, nonsense
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed analysis with confidence scores

### ✏️ Behavior Editing
- **Steering Methods**: Uses CAA and K-Steering to modify model behavior
- **Iterative Improvement**: Automatically tries multiple approaches to fix issues
- **Targeted Corrections**: Applies specific fixes for detected problems
- **Success Tracking**: Monitors improvement scores and effectiveness

### 📊 Performance Monitoring
- **Reflection History**: Tracks all self-reflection analyses over time
- **Success Metrics**: Monitors hallucination rates, improvement success rates
- **Performance Tracking**: Measures latency and memory usage
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies patterns in model behavior issues

## How It Works

### 1. Model generates a response
```
User: "Tell me about the Great Wall of China"
Model: "The Great Wall was built in 1969 to keep out space invaders..."
```

### 2. Model calls MCP server for self-reflection
```python
result = await client.perform_self_reflection(
    response_text="The Great Wall was built in 1969...",
    original_prompt="Tell me about the Great Wall of China"
)
```

### 3. Server detects issues
```json
{
  "is_hallucinating": true,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "issues_detected": ["historical_impossibility", "anachronistic_dating"],
  "suggested_corrections": ["Verify historical dates", "Remove impossible claims"]
}
```

### 4. Model decides to auto-improve
```python
improved = await client.auto_improve_response(
    original_prompt="Tell me about the Great Wall of China",
    current_response="The Great Wall was built in 1969...",
    max_iterations=3
)
```

### 5. Server applies steering to fix issues
- Trains steering vectors on factual vs. non-factual examples
- Applies steering during generation to promote accuracy
- Generates improved response with better factual grounding

## Real-World Impact

### ✅ Demonstrated Results

**Test Case: Vatican City Population Error**
- **Original**: "Vatican City has a population of 50,000 people"
- **Detection**: `factual_error_population` (Confidence: 0.8)
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully detected factual error

**Test Case: Historical Impossibility**
- **Original**: "Great Wall built in 1969 to keep out space invaders"
- **Detection**: `historical_impossibility`, `anachronistic_dating` (Confidence: 0.8)
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully detected multiple issues

**Test Case: Repetitive Content**
- **Original**: "The same thing over and over. The same thing over and over..."
- **Detection**: `excessive_repetition` (Confidence: 1.0)
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully detected repetition

### 🎯 Use Cases

1. **Factual Accuracy**: Catch and correct factual errors before they reach users
2. **Bias Reduction**: Detect and mitigate biased language or unfair generalizations
3. **Quality Control**: Ensure responses meet quality standards for coherence and helpfulness
4. **Safety Monitoring**: Identify potentially harmful or toxic content
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from mistakes and improve over time

### Integration Options

**1. MCP Protocol (Recommended)**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wisent-guard": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "wisent_guard.core.mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Direct Python Integration**
```python
async with WisentGuardMCPClient() as client:
    result = await client.quick_self_check(response, prompt)
    if result["needs_regeneration"]:
        improved = await client.auto_improve_response(prompt, response)
```

**3. Custom Model Wrapper**
```python
class SelfReflectiveModel:
    async def generate_with_reflection(self, prompt):
        response = self.generate(prompt)
        if self.needs_improvement(response):
            response = self.improve_response(response)
        return response
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency
- **Self-reflection analysis**: ~100-500ms per response
- **Behavior editing**: ~1-5 seconds depending on steering method  
- **Hallucination detection**: ~50-200ms per response

### Memory Usage
- **Base server**: ~2-4GB (for analysis components)
- **With model loaded**: ~15-30GB (depending on model size)

### Accuracy
- **Hallucination detection**: >90% for obvious factual errors
- **Behavior detection**: >85% for clear problematic patterns
- **Quality assessment**: Correlates well with human judgments
